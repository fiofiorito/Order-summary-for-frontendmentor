# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

![Design preview for the Order summary card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

# Overview:
Here's the link to the order summary:

# My challenge:
This time my challenge was applying not only what I know but also the things I received as feedback on my last activity, which was the QR one. So I applied that and then my second challenge was the positioning of every element inside the white box! I used position: relative; I know its probably not the best becuase when you look at the order summary on a smaller screen everything gets messed up. I will eventually learn how to fix that, I haven't started with the responsive part of web development

# What I learned:
I learned how to add shadows! and I am beggining to understand how creating buttons with css works!
